	<p>garbagecat parses Java garbage collection logging and provides
		analysis to support JVM tuning and troubleshooting for OpenJDK and Sun
		JDK. It differs from other tools in that it goes beyond the simple
		math of calculating statistics such as maximum pause time and
		throughput. It adds context to these numbers by identifying the
		associated collector or collector phase, which allows for much deeper
		insight and analysis. This is especially relevant to collectors such
		as the Concurrent Mark Sweep collector that have multiple concurrent
		and stop-the-world phases.</p>
