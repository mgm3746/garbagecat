/**
 * Permanent generation or metaspace data.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In JDK7 the decommissioning of the perm gen space began when interned strings and class static variables were moved
 * to the Java heap, and symbols were moved to the native heap.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In JDK8 the perm gen space was fully replaced by the metaspace, a native space holding only class metadata. The value
 * in the gc logging is the sum of the committed compressed class space (CompressedClassSpaceSize) and the other class
 * metadata.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike perm gen, it is typically not necessary to set a max/min metaspace size:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Metaspace size is unlimited by default. Since it only holds class metadata, size requirements are minimal.</li>
 * <li>It does not require a full gc to resize the metaspace, as it did with the perm generation.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Reference: JEP 122: Remove the Permanent Generation, https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/122.
